# Summary:
This talk was about the work done in training a machine learning model for using genes or proteins as identifiable checkpoints in determining prostate cancer stage progression. We see the classifier used called the k-set classifier, and each step involved in going from a dataset to preprocessing and clustering. Clustering is when comparing each data sample stage with its neighbouring stage to show what junctions show up that leads to the next stage.

# Questions:

 1. Do the different kinds of prostate cancer affect the categorization process?

 2. Does this model work on other types of cancer? Why do you choose to work on the dataset for prostate cancer in particular?
