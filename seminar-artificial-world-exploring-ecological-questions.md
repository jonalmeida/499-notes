# Summary:
This seminar was exploring the findings from using EcoSim to understand species evolution/reproduction. Species abundance patterns simulated in EcoSim are observed in real world eco-systems. One of the findings are that we see the genome of a prey evolving faster with the presence of a predator. When a predator is removed from the systerm, we notice that the prey tends to stay close to the sources of food. There is a complex dynamic between the predator, prey and food where you expect a simple model of predator -> prey -> plant chain, but instead we notice that one species can be indirectly influenced.

# Questions:

 1. Would there be a bias between species in choice between a partner when reproducing?

 2. Would you consider random changes (e.g. DNA chaining changes) affecting some species becoming the dominant species type into your model on EcoSim?
