# Summary:

With more optical networks being used, energy-efficient routing models need to be created to decrease the amount of energy taken to transfer data. This seminar is about doing this by reducing the cost of the "light paths" taken. Each node that data may need to pass through has control over the paths available, and the ability to turn down the energy consumption used.

We consider different routing algorithms inorder to do this such as anycast; selecting a single node from a range of available nodes. It uses a genetic algorithm for solving this by meeting a certain demands and still minimizing power consumption.

# Questions:

 1. We didn't see a full power consumption break down of the energy cost into turning on/off a node. What would be energy required in turning off a light path or several light paths?

 2. How would a case where a node would go completely offline and a re-routing would need to be done? Is there a master node that monitors the performance of the other nodes?
