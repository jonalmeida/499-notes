# Summary:

This seminar was about retrieving information from a car's onboard system, or using various proximity detection systems, for collision avoidance and reducing "time to collision". Information about the car is collected via the CAN bus controller (a micro controller available across all cars), and communicate with the cars around it to inform them whether the car is speeding up or slowing down.

# Questions:

 1. For the research that involves only GPS data, how do you compensate for a loss of connection?

 2. Is there a communication protocol already in place for car-to-car communication? i.e. Is there a proprierty block that may be a problem to continue your research?

 3. What security precautions are being taken to avoid malicious data being sent or other (personal identifiable) information isn't being read?
