This talk was an overview of the Sylectus business, how it is run, the technology stack and the software development process they follow. It uses GPS tracking on select trucks and driver updates which can be done through their website or mobile interface.

With more optical networks being used, energy-efficient routing models need to be created to decrease the amount of energy taken to transfer data. This seminar is about doing this by reducing the cost of the "light paths" taken. Each node that data may need to pass through has control over the paths available, and the ability to turn down the energy consumption used.

We consider different routing algorithms inorder to do this such as anycast; selecting a single node from a range of available nodes. It uses a genetic algorithm for solving this by meeting a certain demands and still minimizing power consumption.

# Questions:

 1. Why did QA start only in 2012 and not when the company first started and during the development phase?

 2. How has a relational DBMS helped your business? Have you considered a NoSQL system?
