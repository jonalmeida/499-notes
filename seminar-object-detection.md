# Summary:
This talk was about a proposal for object detection using Active Contour Modelling. It talked about edge-based ACM, such as if the edges are weak, the modelling function would pass through. Instead, using a Microsoft Kinect, you can add a depth clue to help. Evaluation is done using dice similarity scores. Some of the limitations are image distortion, parrallel line intersect, and being unable to see end of overlaping objects (although there is a way around this).

# Questions:

 1. How accurate is the object detection in low light images? Won't alpha values be high?

 2. What's the speed of object detection using this method?
