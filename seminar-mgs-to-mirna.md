# Summary:
This talk was about the computational use cases of binoinformatics. The motivation to get bioinformatic data. How using the this data you can find the genome in breast cancer cells because of the sufficient information provided to find chains.
We hear about the first legal bioinformatics case that was used during 9/11 for identifying victims.
Given a sequence, how you can identify it's annotations, structure, genes and indel variations. As well as miRNA predictions which are difficult in wheat analysis.

# Questions:

 1. Are you working with any of the genomic companies like 23andMe to use anonymouse gene datasets?

 2. What kind of model is used to predict plants with miRNA?
