# Summary:
This seminar covers identification of algorithms that explore unknown environments. A brief overview is given on what these robots are capable of and definitions used later in the seminar: Robot OS is the software interface between the hardware and coverage algorithm to be implemented. In most cases, we are not given a map of the area to explore, so a specific algorithm called SLAM is used to do this while also keeping track of the robot's location. While there is no explicit problem that is trying to be solved, the objective of this research study is to find the place where computation and coverage overlay is minimized.

# Questions:

 1. Are there different types of unknown environments that you would have to consider?

 2. How would robots communicate if the network is limited? Is network connectivity the limiting factor?
