# Initial Phase

 - Read lecture notes Dr. Chen provided.
 - Research possible frameworks to use.
    - Consider a web-based solution so that it's easily accessible.
    - [D3js](http://d3js.org/) specializes in data visualization.
    - Ask people on mailing lists/irc.
 - Create a flowchart the scenarios of each algorithm
    - Consider failure cases.
    - Randomization of various cases should be added.
 - More sources to check out: [here][1]

## Preliminary process

1. Choose a quick framework and try to start a basic implementation
2. Start with Totally Ordered Multicasting; this is easier to implement.
    - Use this implementation time to get a better understanding of what frameworks will help for the next (harder) visualization.
3. Continue from there..
