# Summary:
This seminar was a masters proposal that talked about augmented reality (AR) today, the search patterns used in predefined environments, and the look into the SLAM approach for AR.

Current AR uses grids, way points, and NavMesh (convex polygon sets) for path finding. It uses markers in the form of 3D/2D shapes. Marker-less AR doesn't have these shapes and relies on sensors. This uses the simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) approach which is a way of constructing a map of an unknown environment. The specific area of research will look into using a Microsoft Kinect to get depth data and create point cloud information for construction a map.
