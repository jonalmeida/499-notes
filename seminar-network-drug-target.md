# Summary:
This talk was about the process of finding interactions of a drug with proteins. We do not look at side-effects that are created, but purely the likelihood of interactions. We look at the different kinds of similarity models for testing, which include chemical, ARC, and SIDER similarities. Using data, a network of interactions is created that will then be used to see which drugs can interact with which proteins.

# Questions:

 1. Do you consider multiple drug interactions with one protein?

 2. How far is your work from creating an automated process to speed up the testing process?
