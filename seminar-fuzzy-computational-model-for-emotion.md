# Summary:
This seminar was about creating a computational model for analyzing emotions using fuzzy modelling for transitions between two emotions by use of automata states as well as affect control theory. The problem is that measuring emotion is hard so fuzzy modelling is used to  measure from one level to another giving us different automata states that we can transition between to get to the next emotion.

# Questions:

 1. How are events with different emotions calculated?

 2. Is this assuming a person reacts to our "normal" model of data? i.e. Sad to Happy?

 3. How would you calibrate this model from data retrieved by, or updated emotional understanding?
