# Summary:
This talk is about a certain type of data analysis using mass spectrometry (MS) used to discover new interactions with other compounds or cells. Dr. Stemmer talks about three applications of MS-based proteomics that he's worked on with collaboration from other teams. Mercury Toxicity; finding proteins of a single strand that can be quantified. Proteomics discovery for spinal muscular atrophy; finding developmentally what is going on using the SILAC method. Identification of Calmodulin binding proteins; interaction with calmodulin and other proteins.
