# Summary:

This seminar was about how navigation works, and what are the ways to navigate home and avoid getting lost. We learn that from ants, updating home is based on self-movements which are called Path Integration (PI) - this uses vector summation and requires no external sources. PI is good for short distances, but fails to work for advanced long distance navigation. For advanced navigation, PI is a subset in the process of creating a "Mental Map". This is a three step process: Converting PI to Spatial Updating (SU), Storage & Re-calibration.

# Questions:

> The answers are paraphrased and may contain errors.

 1. Can you reduce the number of vectors by removing vector points that are close together?
    - Answer: From tests, it seems that some vector points form clusters of local vector points that are very close together, but it's not definitive since we can't ask subjects if this is actually what they're doing.

 2. Preventing SU failure by forced updates requires constant use of computation - is this feasible?
    - Answer: It is because the computation is about the same in total because the subjects would remove an older vector, so updating that vector would remove the computation involved.
