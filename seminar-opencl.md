# Summary:
For the seminar, AJ talked about what Khonos is as an organization; an organization to make standards for hardware abstraction. We started by discussing the current abstraction layer that we have between hardware/software and how Khronos members have been working on OpenCL for portable heterogeneous computing. OpenCL will be a new hardware/software interface without the operating system and compiler stack between the two. The killer features will be having hardware traits so you can write code once for all hardware architectures (e.g. mobile, desktop, super computers).

# Questions:

 1. How will existing (system) languages have to be reworked to use the power of OpenCL?

 2. With all of the OpenCL decisions happening behind closed doors, won't this affect the future of the projects and the spec (even with proposed open panels)?
